This project can be built using Netbeans 4.1 or IntelliJ 10.

It differs from jid3 v0.46 by forcing UTF-16LE output, which provides
compatibility with Windows Media Player 9-11, which display error
messages if UTF-16BE encoded tags are included in the MP3 file
(which happens when jid3 is run on Linux or Mac, but not Windows).

Yay Java.
